mukaGL
=======

Software implementation of a (very) tiny subset of OpenGL.

The purpose of this project is to teach myself a bit more about 3d math and rendering pipeline.

##Prerequisites

```
SDL2 development libraries
OpenGL development libraries (GL,GLU,GLUT)
```

OpenGL libraries are required to build the examples since both mukaGL and OpenGL versions are built.

##Building

```
$ make
```

##Running

```
./examples/points1/points1 & ./examples/points1/points1-gl
```
