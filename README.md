mukaGL
=======

Software implementation of a (very) tiny subset of OpenGL.

##Prerequisites

```
OpenGL development libraries (GL,GLU,GLUT)
X11 development libraries
```

OpenGL is required to build the examples since both mukaGL and OpenGL versions are built.

##Building

```
$ make
```

##Running

```
./examples/points1/points1 & ./examples/points1/points1-gl
```
